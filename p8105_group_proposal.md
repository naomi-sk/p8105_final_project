#### Tentative Project Title

The impact of NYC Environmental Determinants on Children’s Health

#### Motivation for this project

Children’s health and development is impacted by the surrounding
environment, particularly in dense urban environments like New York City
(NYC). Poor air quality due to urban air pollution can influence and
have long-term consequences for child and adolescent respiratory health.
The challenges of urban environmental health are further complicated by
climate change, particularly through the urban heat island effect, which
can increase the risk of heat-related illnesses. Limited research shows
that elevated temperatures due to the urban heat island effect are
associated with increased emergency department (ED) visits among
children (Sheffield et al., 2018). These health outcomes may be
influenced by the availability of green spaces, which can help filter
air pollutants and provide cooler areas for shelter from heat.
Importantly, environmental health risks disproportionately affect
children from low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where
there is often limited access to green spaces and higher exposure to
environmental stressors.

Through this project, we aim to investigate how these interconnected
environmental determinants- air quality, green space availability, and
urban heat patterns - vary across NYC boroughs and their potential
associations with children’s health, specifically focusing on
respiratory outcomes and ED visits. We believe that understanding these
relationships is crucial for informing urban planning policies and
public health initiatives aimed at improving children’s health in New
York City.
