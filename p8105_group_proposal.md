#### Tentative Project Title

The impact of NYC Environmental Determinants on Children’s Health

#### Motivation for this project

Children’s health and development is impacted by the surrounding
environment, particularly in dense urban environments like New York City
(NYC). Poor air quality due to urban air pollution can influence and
have long-term consequences for child and adolescent respiratory health.
The challenges of urban environmental health are further complicated by
climate change, particularly through the urban heat island effect, which
can increase the risk of heat-related illnesses (Heaviside et al.,
2017). Limited research shows that elevated temperatures due to the
urban heat island effect are associated with increased emergency
department (ED) visits among children (Sheffield et al., 2018). These
health outcomes may be influenced by the availability of green spaces,
which can help filter air pollutants and provide cooler areas for
shelter from heat. Importantly, environmental health risks
disproportionately affect children from low-income neighborhoods and
communities of color, where there is often limited access to green
spaces and higher exposure to environmental stressors.

Through this project, we aim to investigate how these interconnected
environmental determinants- air quality, green space availability, and
urban heat patterns - vary across NYC boroughs and their potential
associations with children’s health, specifically focusing on
respiratory outcomes and ED visits. We believe that understanding these
relationships is crucial for informing urban planning policies and
public health initiatives aimed at improving children’s health in New
York City.

#### Anticipated Data Sources

- Environmental data:

New York City Air Quality (Kaggle:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahityasetu/new-york-city-air-quality>)

NOAA Weather Data for temperature
(<https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html>)

NYC Parks and Recreation Data (<https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/data>)

- Health and demographic data:

For ED visits and respiratory health outcomes
(<https://a816-health.nyc.gov/hdi/epiquery/visualizations?PageType=ts&PopulationSource=Syndromic&Topic=1&Subtopic=39>)

#### Intended final product

The intended final project will be a form of a research report,
summarizing the associations between environmental factors and pediatric
health outcomes across NYC boroughs. Alternatively, if geared toward
public health policy, we could also have a final product as a policy
brief or recommendation for city planners and public health officials.

#### The planned analysis / visualization / coding challenges

There may be some challenges with missing data and merging data between
different data sources, particularly when working collaboratively and in
parallel with our team. The main analytical challenge will be building
appropriate linear models to explore the effects of multiple
environmental variables (air quality, temperature, green space) on
health outcomes with the data available to us, while accounting for
relevant demographic factors.

Our planned analyses:

1.  Data Wrangling: Clean, tidy, and merge environmental, health, and
    demographic datasets

2.  Visualization (exploratory analysis)

    1.  Descriptive data visualization using basic plots

    2.  Simple maps using borough boundaries

    3.  Paneled plots to compare boroughs

    4.  Interactive dashboard using flexdashboard

3.  Statistical Analysis

    Linear models to test relationships between:

    1.  Air quality and respiratory health outcomes

    2.  Temperature and ED visits

    3.  Effects of greenspace

#### The planned timeline

November 11-15 tidy the data for analysis

November 18-22 Finish the analysis and write the report

November 25-29 finish the report and build a webpage

~ December 6th Finish the rest (screencast, Peer assessment)
